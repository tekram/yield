COMPARISON: None CONTRAST: 70 mL Isovue 370 TECHNIQUE: After the uneventful administration of IV contrast, contiguous axial images were acquired through the chest in the pulmonary arterial phase. Data set was reconstructed into multiple slice thicknesses and reformatted in the sagittal and coronal planes. 3-D reformations were performed on an independent workstation. DOSE: Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 3.8 205.9 mGy. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 209.6 mGy-cm. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol) given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors.  FINDINGS: Central pulmonary arteries are markedly enlarged with the main pulmonary artery measuring 44 mm. Pulmonary vasculature is patent without evidence of filling defects to suggest pulmonary emboli. Thoracic aorta demonstrates normal contour and caliber without evidence of dissection or aneurysmal dilatation. Conventional three-vessel aortic arch branching anatomy is present. Visualized arterial structures are patent without evidence of flow limiting stenoses. Right ventricular and biatrial enlargement are appreciated. No evidence of pericardial effusion. No evidence of pathologically enlarged mediastinal or axillary lymph nodes by CT size criteria. Visualized thyroid gland is unremarkable. Trachea and central bronchi are patent. Bilateral lungs demonstrate diffuse heterogeneous centrilobular contrast enhancement versus groundglass attenuation. There are also more focal areas of perivascular groundglass, which are most pronounced in the right lower lobe. No evidence of focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusions. Limited pulmonary arterial phase evaluation of visualized upper abdominal structures demonstrates no significant abnormalities. Mild multilevel degenerative disk disease is appreciated in the lower thoracic spine. Visualized soft tissues and osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable without evidence of suspicious lesions.  IMPRESSION: 1. NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLUS AS CLINICALLY QUERIED. 2. DIFFUSE HETEROGENEOUS INCREASED CENTRILOBULAR ATTENUATION, WHICH CAN BE SEEN IN THE SETTING OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION AND HEMORRHAGE; HOWEVER CORRELATION WITH SYMPTOMS FOR ACUTE INFECTIOUS OR INFLAMMATORY PROCESS IS RECOMMENDED. MORE FOCAL AREAS OF PERIVASCULAR GROUNDGLASS IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE ARE CONCERNING FOR HEMORRHAGE. 3. MARKED CENTRAL PULMONARY ARTERIAL DILATION AND RIGHT ATRIAL AND VENTRICULAR ENLARGEMENT CONSISTENT WITH KNOWN SEVERE PULMONARY HYPERTENSION WITH ELEVATED RIGHT HEART PRESSURES. 4. LEFT ATRIAL ENLARGEMENT, WHICH CAN BE SEEN IN SETTING OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.

The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS: The main pulmonary artery measures 2.9 cm. The exam is suboptimal secondary to the timing of the contrast bolus; however, there are no filling defects to suggest central pulmonary emboli. The cardiac silhouette is within normal size limits. No pericardial effusion. The thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber. The bronchial arteries are not enlarged. No pleural effusions. No pneumothoraces. The trachea is patent. Evaluation of the lung parenchyma demonstrates a decreased area of consolidation in the anterior right middle lobe. A 0.9 cm area of consolidation just superiorly is unchanged. There is an additional area of consolidation involving the posterior aspect of the right middle lobe which appears slightly more prominent. Several foci of air is present within suggesting necrosis, with intraluminal debris/lesion noted in the proximal branches of the lateral segmental right middle lobe bronchus resulting in moderate-severe narrowing. Mild atelectasis at the lung bases. The visualized thyroid gland is unremarkable. There is no pathologically enlarged axillary, supraclavicular, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.

No evidence of pathologically enlarged mediastinal or axillary lymph nodes by CT size criteria. Visualized thyroid gland is unremarkable. Trachea and central bronchi are patent. Scattered pulmonary parenchymal nodules are identified including a 2 mm nodule in the left upper lobe (series 6 image 160), 4 mm nodule in the left upper lobe (series 6 image 122), 8 x 6 mm ill-defined area of groundglass in the right middle lobe (series 6 image 226), and 8 x 11 mm solid nodule along the right major fissure (series 6 image 227). All nodules are stable since February 2012 and no new nodules are identified. Additional previously described groundglass nodule in the right upper lobe is no longer visualized. Linear areas of likely scarring are appreciated in the inferior lingula and inferomedial right middle lobe. Lungs are otherwise clear without evidence of focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pleural fluid. Limited pulmonary arterial phase evaluation of visualized upper abdominal structures demonstrates no significant abnormalities. Bilateral saline breast implants are in place. Two hypoattenuating lesions in the liver remain too small to characterize but are unchanged since February 2012 and likely represent benign cysts versus hamartomas. Moderate degenerative changes are appreciated throughout the thoracic spine with a similar appearance to the prior exam including multilevel degenerative disk disease, marginal osteophytosis, and endplate sclerosis. Visualized soft tissues and osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable without evidence of suspicious lesions.  IMPRESSION: 1. NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLUS AS CLINICALLY QUERIED. 2. STABLE GROUNDGLASS AND SOLID NODULES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, UNCHANGED SINCE FEBRUARY 2012. FURTHER EVALUATION WITH FOLLOW-UP NONCONTRAST CT OF THE THORAX IS RECOMMENDED IN ONE YEAR TO ESTABLISH STABILITY.

MD|Desser, Terry S MD|CT CHEST PE STUDY (WITH CONTRAST) 8/2/2013 5:35 PM HISTORY: Right-sided chest pain (under breast). Chest pain since last night, worse with inspiration. History aortic root graft following traumatic dissection over one month ago. Ultrasound negative for PTX, possible right effusion. Eval for PE, PNA, PTX. COMPARISON: Correlation is made with prior CT angiogram of the chest dated July 11, 2013. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar contrast-enhanced angiogram of the chest in pulmonary arterial phase was obtained after the uneventful administration of 95 mL of Isovue-300 . Curved planar reformats, volume rendered, and maximum intensity projection images were performed on an independent 3-D workstation. Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 9.00, 11.55. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 385.61. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol) given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS: The examination is technically limited due to significant respiratory motion artifact causing image degradation particularly at the lung bases. This limits assessment of the distal pulmonary arterial tree. Allowing for this, no definite evidence of pulmonary embolus is demonstrated. Again noted is prior graft repair of the descending aorta. The graft begins distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery and extends into the descending thoracic aorta. The phase of IV contrast timing has been optimized towards evaluation of the pulmonary arteries and therefore evaluation of the aorta and aortic graft is otherwise quite limited. The previously demonstrated a known left subclavian artery dissection is also not well assessed on this exam (previous demonstrated CT chest May 16, 2013). Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen, left greater than right with fluid tracking along the oblique fissures. There has been a slight increase in the amount of fluid tracking along the oblique fissures. There is bilateral interlobular septal thickening, raising the possibility of pulmonary edema. There are bilateral lower regions of linear atelectasis and/or scarring present in both lower lobes and the lingula which are stable. There is also persisting atelectasis and/or consolidation within the lingula. The lungs are otherwise stable in appearance with no other acute interval change. There is stable enlargement of the ascending aorta measuring up to 41-mm diameter. No significantly enlarged mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph nodes are identified by CT size criteria. Heart is enlarged. Aortic valvular calcifications are noted. Coronary artery calcifications are noted. A nonunited sternal fracture is again noted. The fracture line is still visible, though there is sclerosis at the fracture in keeping with partial healing. There are multiple bilateral rib fractures which are again demonstrated and are unchanged. No other significant interval change is seen. IMPRESSION: 1.

D-dimer 2000s. r/o PE. COMPARISON: No previous CT chest exams available for comparison. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar contrast-enhanced angiogram of the chest in pulmonary arterial phase was obtained after the uneventful administration of 95 mL of Isovue-300 . Curved planar reformats, volume rendered, and maximum intensity projection images were performed on an independent 3-D workstation. Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 1.50, 7.50, 17.41. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 606.25. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol) given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism demonstrated. There is mild to bilateral dependent atelectasis. A tiny 2-mm nodule is present in the right upper lobe (series 3, image 153) and a 3-mm nodule is seen in the left upper lobe adjacent to the oblique fissure (series 3, image 190). These are nonspecific. The lungs are otherwise clear. No pleural or pericardial effusions are seen. The central airways are patent. No significantly enlarged axillary hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes are identified by CT size criteria. Coronary artery calcifications are noted. The left atrium is enlarged. Degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine. No aggressive appearing osseous lesions are identified. In the visualized upper abdomen, assessment of the abdominal structures as the exam is not been optimized for evaluation. The allowing for this, there appear to be several bilateral renal cysts. The largest arises exophytically from the right kidney measuring 8.0-cm. A 1.6-cm low-density lesion is seen in the right lobe the liver, too small to characterize but statistically most likely a cyst or hemangioma. Several small calcifications are present in the liver likely relating to remote granulomatous disease. No other significant thoracic abnormality was identified.  IMPRESSION: 1. NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM DEMONSTRATED. 2. THERE ARE TWO SMALL NONSPECIFIC PULMONARY NODULES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

FINDINGS: The examination is technically limited due to significant respiratory motion artifact causing image degradation particularly at the lung bases. This limits assessment of the distal pulmonary arterial tree. Allowing for this, no definite evidence of central or lobar branch pulmonary embolus was demonstrated. Given the phase of IV contrast timing, the small filling defect within the right atrium adjacent to the interatrial septum described on the CT abdomen and pelvis of August 3, 2013 this not clearly delineated on the current study due to incomplete contrast opacification of the right atrium. (See the August 3, 2013 CT Abdomen and Pelvis report). There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is moderate to bibasilar atelectasis. There is moderate centrilobular emphysema. Several scattered calcified granulomas are identified which are unchanged the largest measuring 5-mm within the left upper lobe (series 3, image 160). In addition there are several small bilateral nonspecific pulmonary nodules which are unchanged since prior.

MD|Fleischmann, Dominik  MD|EXAM: CT Pulmonary Embolism Chest Only 8/5/2013 11:06 AM CLINICAL HISTORY: R/o PE; also eval post neck COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from August 3, 2013. CONTRAST: 70 mL of Isovue 370. TECHNIQUE: After the uneventful administration of IV contrast, contiguous axial images were acquired through the thorax during the pulmonary arterial phase at 1.25 mm and 5 mm slice thicknesses. Sagittal, coronal and maximum intensity projection reformations were performed. 3D reformations consisting of curved and multiplanar reformations, maximum intensity projections, and volume rendered images were performed on an independent workstation and corroborate the findings. Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 7.39 mGy. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 298.03 mGy-cm. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol)given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS: Contrast opacification of the pulmonary arterial circulation is adequate for assessment for PE. Streak artifact from dense contrast in the SVC slight limits assessment. No definite filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism. Patchy consolidation and ground glass opacification in the right lower lobe is consistent with pneumonia. Intralobular septal thickening is also noted at the right lung base. Ground glass opacification dependently in the left lung likely reflects atelectasis. There are small bilateral pleural effusions layering dependently. Central airways are clear. Enlarged right hilar lymph node measures up to 1.3 cm in short axis dimension, likely reactive. No mediastinal or left hilar lymphadenopathy. Coronary artery calcifications are not seen. Heart is normal in appearance. No pericardial effusion. Aorta has a normal caliber and course. The left vertebral artery arises from the aortic arch. Main pulmonary artery is not enlarged. No supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy. Several heterogeneous thyroid nodules are noted, some of which are partially calcified. Visualized neck is otherwise grossly normal in appearance on this nondedicated study. Upper visualized abdomen is normal in appearance on this arterial phase study. No aggressive osseous lesions. IMPRESSION: 1. STUDY IS SLIGHTLY LIMITED BY STREAK ARTIFACT FROM DENSE CONTRAST IN THE SVC. NO DEFINITE FINDINGS TO SUGGEST PULMONARY EMBOLISM. 2. FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH RIGHT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA.

COMPARISON: None TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar contrast-enhanced angiogram of the chest in pulmonary arterial phase was obtained after the uneventful administration of 100mL of Isovue 370. Curved planar reformats, volume rendered, and maximum intensity projection images were performed on an independent 3-D workstation. Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 19.77. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 664.36. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol) given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS: The main pulmonary artery is mildly enlarged, measuring 3.5 cm. There is suboptimal timing of the contrast bolus and extensive compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe which limits evaluation for emboli in this region; however, there are no filling defects to suggest central pulmonary emboli. The heart is within normal size limits. No pericardial effusion. The descending thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber. There is a large right pleural effusion. No pneumothoraces. The trachea and central bronchi are patent with no evidence of endobronchial lesion. Evaluation of the lung parenchyma demonstrates extensive compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe with partial atelectasis of the right upper and middle lobes. There is a geographic area of decreased enhancement in the right lower lobe, which may represent abscess. There is a 8-mm peripheral right upper lobe nodule on series 3, image 151. Areas of groundglass opacities are noted in the left lower lobes, likely representing atelectasis. The visualized thyroid gland is unremarkable. Several prominent prevascular and right supraclavicular lymph nodes are noted, including a 7 mm prevascular node. There is no pathologically enlarged axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy. The esophagus and gastroesophageal junction are grossly unremarkable. Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates mild thickening of the medial limb of the left adrenal gland. There is an indeterminate 2.2 cm hypodensity in the right hepatic lobe. Visualized osseous structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion. IMPRESSION: 1. EVALUATION IS LIMITED DUE TO SUBOPTIMAL TIMING OF THE CONTRAST BOLUS AND EXTENSIVE RIGHT LOWER LOBE COLLAPSE; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF CENTRAL PULMONARY EMBOLISM. 2. LARGE RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION WITH COMPRESSIVE ATELECTASIS OF THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE. AN OVOID AREA OF DECREASED PERFUSION IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE COULD POSSIBLY REPRESENT AN ABSCESS. 3. 8-MM PERIPHERAL RIGHT UPPER LOBE PULM. NODULE. 4. INDETERMINATE 2.2-CM RIGHT HEPATIC HYPODENSITY.

The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS: The heart size is normal without a pericardial effusion. Extensive coronary artery calcifications are present. The aorta is normal in course and caliber. There is adequate opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree. No filling defects are seen within the pulmonary arterial tree to suggest pulmonary embolism. There is redemonstration of mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen in the prevascular space and in the AP window. There is redemonstration of a necrotic mass in the left axilla which is partially visualized. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is also present worse on the right. No pleural effusions. The airways are patent and of normal course and caliber. There multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules all of which were seen on the prior examination. There is new consolidation at both lung bases right greater than left. Overall, the extent of lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules is similar in distribution with few demonstrating minimal interval growth. Multiple hepatic metastatic lesions are noted grossly stable. There is a gastrohepatic ligament lymph node which appears to be slightly larger. No suspicious bony lesions identified. Finding consistent with DISH is noted. IMPRESSION: 1.

COMPARISON: CT PE 7/27/13 CONTRAST: 60 mL Isovue-300 TECHNIQUE: After the uneventful administration of IV contrast, contiguous axial images were acquired through the chest in the pulmonary arterial phase. Data set was reconstructed into multiple slice thicknesses and reformatted in the sagittal and coronal planes. 3-D reformations were performed on an independent workstation. DOSE: Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 7.6 15.9 mGy. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 514 mGy-cm.

The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors.  FINDINGS: Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again demonstrated compatible with prior lung transplantation. Right chest wall internal jugular Mediport is in place with the tip in the proximal right atrium. Evaluation for pulmonary embolus is markedly limited due to poor contrast opacification of the pulmonary arterial system. There is no gross evidence of large central pulmonary emboli. Main pulmonary artery is upper limits of normal measuring 30 mm in diameter but stable since the prior exam. Thoracic aorta demonstrates normal contour and caliber without evidence of dissection or aneurysmal dilatation. Conventional three-vessel aortic arch branching anatomy is present. Visualized arterial structures are patent without evidence of flow limiting stenoses. Heart size is normal without evidence of pericardial effusion. Visualized thyroid gland is unremarkable. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy most pronounced in the right peritracheal and infracarinal stations is slightly improved since the prior exam of 7/27/13. No evidence of hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy. Trachea and central bronchi are patent. Bilateral lungs again demonstrate extensive groundglass with mid to lower lung predominance, bronchiectasis, and areas of peripheral irregular nodular consolidation. Findings are stable compared to prior exam. No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions. Small hiatal hernia is again demonstrated. Gastrojejunostomy tube is partially visualized. Limited pulmonary arterial phase evaluation of visualized upper abdominal structures otherwise demonstrates no significant abnormalities. Visualized soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable without evidence of suspicious lesions.  IMPRESSION: 1. NO GROSS EVIDENCE OF LARGE CENTRAL PULMONARY EMBOLI; HOWEVER STUDY IS LIMITED DUE TO POOR CONTRAST OPACIFICATION OF THE PULMONARY ARTERIAL SYSTEM. 2. STATUS POST LUNG TRANSPLANT WITH PERSISTENT DIFFUSE GROUND GLASS, BRONCHIECTASIS, AND NODULAR CONSOLIDATION.

Common iliac arteries measure approximately 12 mm indiameter on the right and 14 mm on the left. Liver is normal in morphology and attenuation. A small,approximately 10 mm low attenuating lesion in the right lobe of theliver is too small to characterize on CT but likely represents acyst. No other focal hepatic lesions demonstrated. No intrahepaticor duct dilatation. Hyperdense sludge layers dependently within thegallbladder. Gallbladder and CBD are otherwise normal. Mild perinephric stranding bilaterally is nonspecific. Nohydronephrosis. Spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands are normal inappearance. A small, round structure is noted at the inferior aspect of the bodyof the stomach which measures approximately 21 x 20 mm in axialdimensions and 17 cm in craniocaudad dimension. This measures at theupper limits of normal for simple fluid. This may represent a smallgastric diverticulum or, less likely, a mass.

CONTRAST: 86 mL of Isovue 370 TECHNIQUE: After the uneventful administration of IV contrast, contiguous axial images were acquired through the thorax during the pulmonary arterial phase at 1.25 mm and 5 mm slice thicknesses. Sagittal, coronal and maximum intensity projection reformations were performed. 3D reformations consisting of curved and multiplanar reformations, maximum intensity projections, and volume rendered images were performed on an independent workstation and corroborate the findings. Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 16.97 mGy. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 651.73 mGy-cm. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol)given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS: Contrast opacification of the pulmonary arterial circulation is excellent for assessment for PE. Several filling defects are present within the pulmonary arterial circulation, consistent with pulmonary embolism. For example, central filling defects within the posterior and lateral basal segmental arteries of the right lower lobe are present. In addition, several scattered segmental and subsegmental filling defects are present within the right middle lobe, right upper lobe, and left lower lobe. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. A prominent 12 mm short axis subcarinal lymph node is not reach CT size criteria for significance. Coronary artery calcifications are not seen. Decreased contrast opacification of the left side of the heart is indicative of right ventricular strain. Heart is otherwise normal in appearance. Trace, physiologic pericardial fluid is present. Aorta has a normal caliber and course. Main pulmonary artery is not enlarged. Hazy ground glass opacification dependently in the lower lobes bilaterally is non-specific and may reflect atelectasis, hemorrhage, or infarction. There is a small right pleural effusion. A couple of tiny, 1-2 mm nodules in the superior segment of the left lower lobe and along the left major fissure laterally are unchanged since 2011. Central airways are clear. No supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper visualized abdomen is normal in appearance on this arterial phase study. No aggressive osseous lesions. IMPRESSION: 1.

COMPARISON: CT thorax high-resolution 8/6/13, Lung V/Q scan 8/6/13 CONTRAST: 115 mL Isovue-300 TECHNIQUE: After the uneventful administration of IV contrast, contiguous axial images were acquired through the chest in the pulmonary arterial phase. Data set was reconstructed into multiple slice thicknesses and reformatted in the sagittal and coronal planes. 3-D reformations were performed on an independent workstation. DOSE: Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 10.0 15.1 mGy. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 505 mGy-cm. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol) given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors.  FINDINGS: Linear and mural filling defects compatible with chronic pulmonary emboli are identified involving the segmental and subsegmental branches of all lobes including the right upper lobe anterior segment, right middle lobe medial segment, right lower lobe superior, posterior basal, and anteromedial basal segments, left upper lobe anterior segment, and left lower lobe anteromedial basal segments. Main pulmonary artery is dilated measuring 39 mm in diameter consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Thoracic aorta demonstrates normal contour and caliber without evidence of dissection or aneurysmal dilatation. Conventional three-vessel aortic arch branching anatomy is present. Visualized arterial structures are patent without evidence of flow limiting stenoses. Right ventricle is enlarged with wall thickening and right atrium is dilated. There is a large pericardial effusion similar to the exam of one day prior. Left anterior descending coronary artery calcifications are identified. No evidence of pathologically enlarged mediastinal or axillary lymph nodes by CT size criteria. There is a 7-mm hypoattenuating lesion in the left thyroid lobe. Trachea and central bronchi are patent. Mosaic attenuation is again demonstrated involving all lobes. A few scattered areas of mild peripheral interlobular septal thickening are also appreciated. There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions with minimal dependent left lower lobe atelectasis. A 6 mm pulmonary parenchymal nodule is again identified in the inferior right lower lobe (series 2 image 101). There is an 8-mm hypoattenuating lesion in left hepatic lobe too small to definitively characterize but likely representing a cyst. There is an 8 x 5 mm hyperdense likely stone in the gallbladder neck, which is incompletely visualized at the edge of the scan field. Limited evaluation of the partially visualized gallbladder demonstrates no evidence of distention or pericholecystic fluid. A 1 cm left adrenal adenoma is also identified. There is an incidental partially calcified 1 cm splenic artery aneurysm in the hilum. Mild to moderate degenerative changes are appreciated the visualized thoracolumbar spine with scattered lytic and sclerotic foci consistent with benign bone islands. Visualized soft tissues and osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable without evidence of suspicious lesions.  IMPRESSION: 1.

The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS: The main pulmonary artery is within normal limits. Evaluation is slightly limited due to timing of the contrast bolus and motion artifact; however, there are no filling defects to suggest pulmonary emboli within the central through segmental pulmonary arteries. The heart is within normal size limits. No pericardial effusion. The thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber. Note is made of a common origin of the brachiocephalic artery and left common carotid artery. No pleural effusions. No pneumothoraces. The trachea and central bronchi are patent.

The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. Findings: Evaluation of the pulmonary artery and its branches shows no filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism. There is normal caliber of the main pulmonary artery. The thoracic aorta is normal in appearance with a conventional branching anatomy. There are enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, including the right paratracheal area which measures approximately 3.1 x 3.0 cm, which is best seen on image 36 of series 5. This adenopathy is continuous with precarinal, azygos and subcarinal lymphadenopathy is which encases the bilateral mainstem bronchi proximally. In the subcarinal region, the adenopathy measures approximately 40.7 x 2.2 by 8.8 cm in its largest dimension, which is best seen on image 26 of series 5. There is also right hilar adenopathy that measures approximately 1.6 cm in AP dimension. There is some mass effect on the left atrium as well as the right upper lobe pulmonary vein. There is subcentimeter left hilar adenopathy. Evaluation of the lung parenchyma shows ground-glass opacity throughout both lungs which may be due to incomplete inspiration. There are no masses or consolidation within the lung parenchyma. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are surgical clips in the right neck at the level of the thyroid gland with some edema of the soft tissues. Please correlate with any recent intervention.

The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS: The main pulmonary artery is mildly enlarged, measuring 3.1 cm. Slightly limited exam secondary to suboptimal timing of the contrast bolus; however, there are no filling defects to suggest pulmonary emboli. The heart is within normal size limits.

COMPARISON: May 7, 2013. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar contrast-enhanced angiogram of the chest in pulmonary arterial phase was obtained after the uneventful administration of 115 mL of Isovue-300. Curved planar reformats, volume rendered, and maximum intensity projection images were performed on an independent 3-D workstation. Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 15.90. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 494. 47. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol) given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS: Again noted is a dual lead right chest pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrial appendage and right ventricle. The left internal jugular MediPort terminates in the superior vena cava. Bilateral breast prostheses again noted. Surgical clips are present in the left axilla. The main pulmonary artery is at the upper limits of normal, measuring 3.0 cm. No filling defects to suggest pulmonary emboli. The heart is within normal size limits. There is mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Mild calcifications noted in the left anterior descending coronary artery and the aorta. No pericardial effusion. The thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber. There is a persistent small right pleural effusion which has decreased compared to prior exam. Interval resolution of the left pleural effusion. Evaluation of the lung parenchyma is slightly limited due to motion artifact. Diffuse innumerable small ground glass centrilobular opacities and tree-in-bud are noted in all five lobes with improvement in consolidative opacities. Nodular consolidation in the left upper lobe measures 7 mm and 8 mm in the left lower lobe with other persistent areas of consolidation remain in the bilateral lower lobes. Given extensive lung disease, metastatic pulmonary disease is cannot be excluded. No pneumothoraces. The trachea and central bronchi are patent.  There is persistent mediastinal lymphadenopathy. For example, an aortopulmonary lymph node measures 10 mm on series 2, image 231 (previously 9 mm). A precarinal lymph node measures 9 mm in on series 2, image 231 (previously 9 mm). A left precarinal node measures 8 mm on series 2, image 231 (previously 9 mm). A prominent left supraclavicular lymph node measures 8 mm on series 2, image 328 (previously 8 mm). There is no axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy. The visualized thyroid gland is unremarkable. The esophagus and gastroesophageal junction are grossly unremarkable. Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates cholecystectomy clips and clips within the anterior abdominal wall. A calcified granuloma is present at the hepatic dome. Visualized osseous structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion. IMPRESSION: 1. NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM 2. IMPROVED BUT PERSISTENT INNUMERABLE SMALL CENTRILOBULAR GROUNDGLASS OPACITIES AND TREE-IN-BUD WITH FEW NODULAR OPACITIES AND OVERALL DECREASED CONSOLIDATION.

CONTRAST: 100 mL of Isovue-300. TECHNIQUE: After the uneventful administration of IV contrast, contiguous axial images were acquired through the thorax during the pulmonary arterial phase at 1.25 mm and 5 mm slice thicknesses. Sagittal, coronal and maximum intensity projection reformations were performed. 3D reformations consisting of curved and multiplanar reformations, maximum intensity projections, and volume rendered images were performed on an independent workstation and corroborate the findings. Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 15.90 mGy. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 427.67 mGy-cm. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol)given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS: Contrast opacification of the pulmonary arterial circulation is adequate for assessment for PE. Study is significantly limited by motion artifact. No evidence of suspicious filling defects to the level of the proximal segmental arteries. Enlarged, calcified based on lymph nodes are present, consistent with previous granulomatous infection. An enlarged low right paratracheal lymph node measures approximately 14 mm in short axis dimension. An enlarged subcarinal lymph node measures 17 mm. no hilar lymphadenopathy. Coronary artery calcifications are present. Heart is normal in appearance. No pericardial effusion. Aorta has a normal caliber and course. Main pulmonary artery is not enlarged. Several scattered pulmonary nodules are again noted, which are unchanged since the prior study from June 2013. There is a new fat density nodular opacity anteromedially in the lingula which abuts the mediastinum that was not clearly present previously. This measures approximately 9 x 7 mm. A few calcified granulomas are noted. There is a new moderate left pleural effusion with associated passive atelectasis. Loculated fluid is present within the left major fissure. Paravertebral fibrosis is noted medially in the right lower lobe associated with bronchiolectasis. Mild right basilar atelectasis. No right pleural effusion. No supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy. A calcified granuloma is again noted at the dome of the liver, unchanged. Upper visualized abdomen is otherwise normal in appearance on this arterial phase study. No aggressive osseous lesions. Multilevel anterior bridging osteophytes are consistent with DISH. IMPRESSION: 1. STUDY IS SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED BY MOTION ARTIFACT. NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM TO THE LEVEL OF THE PROXIMAL SEGMENTAL ARTERIES, WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY. 2. NEW MODERATE LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION WITH A LOCULATED COMPONENT WITHIN THE MAJOR FISSURE. 3. SCATTERED PULMONARY NODULES PREVIOUSLY NOTED ON STUDY OF JUNE 2013 ARE UNCHANGED.

COMPARISON: June 24, 2013 TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar contrast-enhanced angiogram of the chest in pulmonary arterial phase was obtained after the uneventful administration of IV contrast. Curved planar reformats, volume rendered, and maximum intensity projection images were performed on an independent 3-D workstation. Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 1.5, 10.5, 7.9 mGy. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 254.6 mGy-cm. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol)given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors.  FINDINGS: Evaluation of the pulmonary arteries demonstrates no segmental or lobar emboli in the lower lobes and no lobar arteries in the upper lobes. Greater pulmonary arterial detail is precluded secondary to poor contrast bolus. Evaluation of the heart demonstrates normal heart size. No pericardial effusions. Coronary arteries show calcification. Evaluation of the axilla, mediastinum, and hilum demonstrates no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates a spiculated right upper lobe mass, previously measuring 20 x 26 mm, now 23 x 17 mm. Adjacent nodule (3/124) measures 4 mm, previously 6 mm. Innumerable other nodules seen in both lungs previously are much less conspicuous compared to prior. There are underlying emphysematous changes of the lungs. Wedge-shaped areas of ground glass are seen in the bilateral upper lobes (3/162, 3/161), new compared to prior, possibly related to early infection, treatment effect, or edema. No pleural effusions. Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen in pulmonary arterial contrast phase demonstrates no gross abnormalities. Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates no suspicious appearing lesions. IMPRESSION: 1. NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM, HOWEVER ASSESSMENT OF SEGMENTAL AND SUBSEGMENTAL ARTERIAL BRANCHES IS LIMITED SECONDARY TO POOR CONTRAST BOLUS. 2. MARKED INTERVAL IMPROVEMENT IN SIZE AND CONSPICUITY OF MULTIPLE BILATERAL PULMONARY NODULES SEEN IN THE PRIOR STUDY. THERE IS ALSO A MILD DECREASE IN SIZE OF THE DOMINANT RIGHT UPPER LOBE MASS. 3.

COMPARISON: CT PE 10/19/12 CONTRAST: 80 mL Isovue 300 TECHNIQUE: After the uneventful administration of IV contrast, contiguous axial images were acquired through the chest in the pulmonary arterial phase. Data set was reconstructed into multiple slice thicknesses and reformatted in the sagittal and coronal planes. 3-D reformations were performed on an independent workstation. DOSE: Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 15.0 16.1 mGy. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 534 mGy-cm. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol) given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors.  FINDINGS: Pulmonary vasculature is patent without evidence of filling defects to suggest pulmonary emboli. Main pulmonary artery is mildly dilated measuring 30 mm. Thoracic aorta demonstrates mild calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque and is normal in contour and caliber without evidence of dissection or aneurysmal dilatation. Incidental normal variant two-vessel aortic arch is identified with a common origin of the right brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries. Visualized arterial structures are patent without evidence of flow limiting stenoses. Right ventricle is enlarged and thickened and right atrium is dilated. No evidence of pericardial effusion. Scattered nonspecific subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes are identify, which may be reactive. No evidence of pathologically enlarged mediastinal or axillary lymph nodes by CT size criteria. Visualized thyroid gland is unremarkable. There is slight interval increased size of a cystic lesion inferior to the right mandible measuring 26 x 28 mm, previously 23 x 24 mm. Trachea and central bronchi are patent. Severe emphysematous changes are again demonstrated with asymmetric involvement of the right middle lobe including large bullae and hyperinflation with associated volume loss in the right upper lobe and right lower lobe.

Stable areas of thickening are identified along the right major and minor fissures. There is a small area of peripheral scarring versus atelectasis in the left lower lobe. No evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion or focal consolidation. There is a stable 12-mm hypoattenuating lesion in the left hepatic lobe, likely representing a cyst. Limited pulmonary arterial phase evaluation of visualized upper abdominal structures otherwise demonstrates no significant abnormalities. Minimal degenerative changes are appreciated thoracic spine. Visualized soft tissues and osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable without evidence of suspicious lesions.  IMPRESSION: 1. NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLUS AS CLINICALLY QUERIED. NO EVIDENCE OF ACUTE CARDIOPULMONARY PROCESS. 2. SEVERE EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGES WITH ASYMMETRIC BULLOUS DISEASE AND HYPERINFLATION INVOLVING THE RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE ARE STABLE COMPARED TO 10/19/12.

Sagittal, coronal and maximum intensity projection reformations were performed. 3D reformations consisting of curved and multiplanar reformations, maximum intensity projections, and volume rendered images were performed on an independent workstation and corroborate the findings. Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 17.76 mGy. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 521.16 mGy-cm.

The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS: Contrast opacification of the pulmonary arterial circulation is suboptimal for assessment for PE. No evidence of suspicious filling defects to the level of the segmental arteries concerning for pulmonary embolism. Narrowing is noted of the anterior and medial basal segmental arteries in the right lower lobe. Scattered subcentimeter mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes do not reach CT size criteria for significance. Coronary artery calcifications are not seen. Right atrium and ventricle are enlarged, unchanged. Heart is otherwise normal in appearance. No pericardial effusion. Proximal ascending aorta is mildly ectatic. Descending thoracic aorta is tortuous. Main pulmonary artery is not enlarged. Low inspiratory lung volumes. Ground glass opacification in the lungs has improved in comparison to the prior study, due to improved inspiration. However, patchy ground glass opacity persists, in part due to atelectasis. Perihilar and peripheral ground glass opacity in the left upper lobe is of uncertain etiology. Several scattered pulmonary nodules are again noted. Largest is in the right middle lobe (series 2, image 160) and it measures 7 x 4 mm, in. Largest nodules on the left are in the left upper lobe (series 2, image 203) and left lower lobe inferiorly (series 2, image 31). Central airways are clear. No pleural effusions. No supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper visualized abdomen is normal in appearance on this arterial phase study. No aggressive osseous lesions. Hardware is again noted in the region of C6-7, incompletely visualized. IMPRESSION: 1. STUDY IS SUBOPTIMAL FOR ASSESSMENT FOR PE.
