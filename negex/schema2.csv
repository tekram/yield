#The schema consists of a numeric value, followed by a label (e.g. "AMBIVALENT"), followed by a Python express that can evaluate to True or False
#The Python expression uses LABELS from the rules. processReports.py will substitute the LABEL with any matched values identified from 
#the corresponding rules
